# 4-Bit to 4-Digit Counter
This simulates a system where we can map just 4 bits of the microcontroller to show 4-digit numbers on 4-digit seven segment. Here we design a counter that can count up to 1000 and reset the counter when reaching the maximum number, which can be defined in the source code. In the following GIFs, we illustrate this design with the maximum count set to be 99. You can show which digits; units, tens, hundreds, and thousands to be active, i.e. shown, on the 7-segment.
